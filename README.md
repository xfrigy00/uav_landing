uav_landing
=========

Software packages for automatic landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle, along with the software necessary for the successful commissioning of the algorithm.

## Contents of individual packages and files
#### Software package uav_landing
   * action/Landing.action: An action used by the algorithm to set an action goal, notify about the success of the action goal, and send feedback.

         # Goal - Desired final height in meters
         float64 target_height
         ---
         # Result - Landing state: 1 - landed successfully, 2 - landing canceled
         int8 status_code
         ---
         # Feedback - Current drone height in meters
         float64 current_height

   * calibrationdata_pinhole/ost.yaml: Calibrated camera parameters
   * start/start.sh: With the command `./start.sh` in the terminal can be used to start tmux
   * start/uav_landing.yml: Lists the commands that will be opened within tmux

#### Software package uav_landing_cpp
   * src/landing_action_server.cpp: Action server with the implementation of regulation and setting the speed,, ramp during startup, critical states of the algorithm etc.
   * src/landing_action_client.cpp: Action client with implementation of optical marker detection, server connection or disconnection detection, sending action goal, receiving feedback, etc.
   
   More information is provided in the comments of the codes
#### Software package aruco_ros
   * Aruco marker detection package downloaded from https://github.com/pal-robotics/aruco_ros
   * Detection is performed using the detectors `single.launch.py`, `single_1.launch.py` ​​and `single_2.launch.py`, in which it is possible to set the topic from which the camera parameters are subscribed, the output image from the camera, the size of the marker and its ID

#### pylon_camera_wrapper_config.zip
   * Configuration file for the software package from https://github.com/basler/pylon-ros-camera/tree/humble, specifically for `pylon_ros2_camera_wrapper`, which allows setting fps and a relative path to the file with calibrated camera parameters

Starting detectors, individual echoes for detector poses, and the algorithm consisting of an action server and an action client by moving to file `uav_landing/start` and the following command `./start.sh`

Stopping the algorithm and all other sessions is possible with `tmux kill-server` and stopping only a specific session with `tmux kill-session`
